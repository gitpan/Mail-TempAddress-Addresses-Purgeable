NAME
    Mail::TempAddress::Addresses::Purgeable - manage and purge
    Mail::TempAddress::Address objects

SYNOPSIS
      use Mail::TempAddress::Addresses::Purgeable;
      my $addresses = Mail::TempAddress::Addresses::Purgeable(
        '.addresses'
      );
  
DESCRIPTION
    Mail::TempAddress::Addresses::Purgeable extends
    Mail::TempAddress::Addresses to provide the ability to purge expired
    address data files.

METHODS
    * purge( [ $min_expired_age ] )
        The purge method iterates through each data file found in the
        addresses directory. Each data file is loaded into a
        Mail::TempAddress::Address object and it's expiry date (if any) is
        compared against the current time. Any object which is expired will
        have it's data file removed from the filesystem.

        By default each object need only be expired. Passing the
        $min_expired_age requires that the object have been expired for at
        least that many seconds. The minimum age may also be passed using a
        freeform expression like '1h30m' or '2m1w'. See "Expires" in
        Mail::TempAddress for more details.

        For example, if an address object is set to expire at Mon Oct 27
        19:31:39 2003 and the purge() routine is run at 19:33 with an
        argument of 300, then the data file for the object will not be
        deleted. If the purge method were to be called at 19:36:40 or any
        time thereafter then the data file will be deleted.

    * addresses()
        The <data_files> method returns a list or list reference (depending
        on calling context) of the addresses in the address directory.

TODO
    Major things. chromatic's modules Mail::TempAddress and Mail::SimpleList
    have large quantities of similar code and he plans to factor that out
    into a separate base class. Once that happens, the functionality
    provided by this module would better be implemented as a mixin (see
    mixin).
